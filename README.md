Some linux config files that I use.

NOTE !!!
These configs use some specific properties like monitor names etc. so it will need some tinkering to work on other machines

Included configs:

1. i3 window manager {./i3, ./i3blocks/, ./i3status/, ./scripts/}
2. kitty terminal emulator {./kitty/}
3. neovim text editor {./nvim/}
4. rofi application launcher {./rofi/}
5. sway window manager {./sway/, ./swaylock/}

Also includes software install script for arch and arch based systems {./software-install-script-arch.sh}
