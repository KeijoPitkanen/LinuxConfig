Some linux config files that I use.

NOTE !!!
These configs use some specific properties like monitor names etc. so it will need some tinkering to work on other machines

Included configs:

1. kitty terminal emulator {./kitty/}
2. neovim text editor {./nvim/}
3. rofi application launcher {./rofi/}
4. sway window manager {./sway/, ./swaylock/}

Also includes software install script for arch and arch based systems {./software-install-script-arch.sh}
